        <p>A website is a great place for customers to find, learn about, and engage with your business on the internet. It serves as an online home for your business that you can update to fit your needs.
           Whether you want to share videos and company stories, sell physical and digital products with ecommerce, provide customer reviews and discussion boards, or capture new customer leads with online forms, there’s plenty you can do to make your website work for you.

            Your website’s domain name should be memorable, concise, and easy to share. It should be easy for customers to type, and also something you can quickly share in conversation and in written promotional materials. Try saying “Visit us at…” with your website’s name aloud. If it sounds awkward or takes too long, consider another option for your domain.

         Here are some helpful tips to consider when naming your website.

         Keep it short. Do not exceed 2-3 words.
         Keep it simple. Shorter, uncomplicated names are easier to remember.
         Include keywords. Adding words about what you do or where you’re located, like “Bakery” or “Seattle,” can help customers find you at a glance.
         Avoid misspellings. Non-conventional spellings may be popular, but they can make your website difficult to find or seem suspicious.
         Letters only. Including numbers and dashes in your domain increases the odds of typos and can lower your perceived credibility.

        <ul>
           <li> Change the domain ending. The most common TLD (top-level-domain) is .com, but Google Domains has more than 300 TLDs available, including endings like “.photography”, “.coffee”, and “.store.”</li>
           <li>Tweak the name. For example, “JoesCoffee.com” may be taken, but “JoesCoffeeSeattle.com” and “DrinkJoesCoffee.com” could be available. Get creative with your tweaks, but keep it simple.</li>
           <li>Try to buy it. If you’re really set on your first choice, you can always offer to purchase the name you want from the current owner.</li>
           <ol>
            <li>First order list</li>
           </ol>
